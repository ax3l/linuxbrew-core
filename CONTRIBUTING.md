# Contributing to Linuxbrew

[Linuxbrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core) is a fork of [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core). Homebrew is merged into Linuxbrew roughly once per day. To contribute a new formula or a new version of an existing formula, please submit your pull request to Homebrew rather than to Linuxbrew. Patches to fix issues that you have reproduced on both Linuxbrew and Homebrew should be sent to Homebrew. Please send your pull request to Linuxbrew if you are in doubt.

Patches to fix issues particular to Linux should not affect the behaviour of the formula on Mac. Use `if OS.mac?` and `if OS.linux?` as necessary to preserve the existing behaviour on Mac.

# Contributing to Homebrew

First time contributing to Homebrew? Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Homebrew/.github/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct).

### To report a bug

* run `brew update` (twice)
* run and read `brew doctor`
* read [the Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting)
* open an issue on the formula's repository

### To submit a version upgrade for the `foo` formula

* check if the same upgrade has been already submitted by [searching the open pull requests for `foo`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+foo).
* `brew bump-formula-pr --strict foo` with `--url=...` and `--sha256=...` or `--tag=...` and `--revision=...` arguments.

### To add a new formula for `foo` version `2.3.4` from `$URL`

* read [the Formula Cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook) or: `brew create $URL` and make edits
* `brew install --build-from-source foo`
* `brew audit --new-formula foo`
* `git commit` with message formatted `foo 2.3.4 (new formula)`
* [open a pull request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request) and fix any failing tests

### To contribute a fix to the `foo` formula

If you are already well versed in the use of `git`, then you can find the local
copy of the `homebrew-core` repository in this directory
(`$(brew --prefix)/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/`), modify the formula there
leaving the section `bottle do ... end` unchanged, and prepare a pull request
as you usually do.  Before submitting your pull request, be sure to test it
with these commands:

```
brew uninstall --force foo
brew install --build-from-source foo
brew test foo
brew audit --strict foo
brew style foo
```

After testing, if you think it is needed to force the corresponding bottles to be
rebuilt and redistributed, add a line of the form `revision 1` to the formula,
or add 1 to the revision number already present.

If you are not already well versed in the use of `git`, then you may learn
about it from the introduction at
https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request and then proceed as
follows:

* run `brew edit foo` and make edits
* remove the linux bottle in the `bottle do ... end` section
* test your changes using the commands listed above
* run `git commit` with message formatted `foo <insert new version number>` or `foo: <insert details>`
* open a pull request as described in the introduction linked to above, wait for the automated test results, and fix any failing tests

Thanks!
